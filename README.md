# FriendFinder

### Overview
In this fullstack project, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- based in a dating app. It is a full-stack site that takes in results from your users' surveys, the user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). then compare their answers with those characters in database. The app then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You used Express to handle routing and deployed the app to Heroku and you can check it out here -> https://mighty-garden-95027.herokuapp.com/

### Node.js

To run this FriendFinder, you can clone the repository with this link https://github.com/rickpicolli/FriendFinder.git , install the NPM modules using `npm install` in your terminal, start the server, and try it.

Running the file:
- `server.js`

  - You should see this message above, saying the app is listening the port 8080, which means that you are good to open the page in your brownser (preferably, Chrome) using  `localhost:8080` as a url.
  
  - When you run `localhost:8080` in your browser, you will see the app:

 Take your time to answer the questions and see the best match for you.
